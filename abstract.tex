We consider augmenting prior work for bringing deformable objects into
desired configurations with a reinforcement learning component to
adaptively determine a policy at runtime. By replacing the hand-tuned
physical manipulation of the cloth with a learned sequence of
manipulations, fewer manipulations can be used for distinctive
situations and more manipulations can be used to discriminate
difficult items of clothing.
